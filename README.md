# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart programming and its solution. The `bug.dart` file contains code with insufficient error handling, while `bugSolution.dart` provides an improved version with more robust error handling.

**Problem:** The original code only prints the error to the console.  In a production application, this is insufficient.  The application should gracefully handle the error, perhaps displaying a user-friendly message, retrying the request, or implementing fallback mechanisms.

**Solution:** The improved code uses more sophisticated error handling techniques, such as displaying an informative message to the user and providing better logging.
